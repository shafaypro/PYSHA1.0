    pip install wolframalpha
    pip install pygame
    pip install tkinter

#---- Keep in mind for installing the nltk complete -----
---> Create a .py file and copy this code
>>>import nltk
>>>nltk.download() 
----> the nltk package after installing is like 11 GB so be aware ! 

#----- keep in mind to install some softwares externaly which are -----#
-->Microsoft SDK downlaod  (from the web downlaod or search it , include all the dependencies (700mb) 

--> after you face any type of error , Go to the respective line , if the code error is in the form of exception , 
Keep in mind to use Future Library <-- this will help you to have Back end Compatibility of py3.5 --> py2.7 . 
The Script is made in python 3.5.2 (updated) 

User Guideline:

Wherever you run this Project, the basic dependencies are converted in to the local machine,

--> The machine tells about her self and then wait for the user to have the specified an speech input,

The device of the microphone is connected and then it is parsed to the pyaudio where the input is then

Converted to the Audio file  Formatted as WAV, under the F.L.A.C encoding, then it is parsed to the google api,

since the api is then accessed and the chunks of the audio is converted into the string and then returned into the string.

There are some already stored procedures for the particular messages , like if a message starts from the :::

Search for <--- This opens up the browser for the result so that the Virtual assistant is able to read from the data!!!

Stop,stop listening,quit <---- This will results in the Quiting , exiting for the virtual assistant!!

search ________ on Wikipedia : will search on wikipedia based on certain meaningful words(replaces at _____)

what is the ----> Time, Date and others can tell you the the time ,date and others.
Ther are some other features also added in the header file , like haviing a random chat and working on different kind of
Loops

you can ask for the questions and the Answers regarding to the Natural language processing module .

If you want to ask for the Application running modules then
for that :
RUN or OPEN _________ the Underscore should be replaced by the application name
--> This script will also be monitroing the computer (Here it contains the data analysis and the data visualization part
This will be including the statistical analysis and well as the sentimental analysis . ! so that this may be used in the later
sequences of the version
--> ask for any operation ,, if other than all of the above , it will
--> You can ask the Mathematical operation as : 2+ 3 or integeration of 4 or General Knowledge.
